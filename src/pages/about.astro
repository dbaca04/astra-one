	<h2>Hello, I'm Domdhi</h2>

	<p>
		I created Domdhi as a personal space to document my journey exploring
		the rapidly evolving world of AI tools and technologies. With a
		background in software development and a passion for creative
		problem-solving, I've been fascinated by how AI is transforming both
		technical and creative workflows.
	</p>

	<p>
		This site serves as both a journal of my experiences and a resource hub
		for others interested in incorporating AI into their work and creative
		processes.
	</p>

	<h2>The Domdhi Mission</h2>

	<p>
		My goal with Domdhi is to bridge the gap between AI's technical
		capabilities and practical, everyday applications. I believe that AI
		tools should be accessible to everyone, not just technical specialists,
		and I'm committed to sharing what I learn in a way that's approachable
		and actionable.
	</p>

	<h2>My AI Journey</h2>

	<p>
		My interest in AI began with simple productivity tools but quickly
		expanded as I witnessed the rapid development of models like GPT and
		Stable Diffusion. What started as curiosity has evolved into an ongoing
		exploration of how these technologies can enhance both my professional
		work and creative hobbies.
	</p>

	<p>Along the way, I've developed a particular interest in:</p>

	<ul class="values-list">
		<li>
			<strong>AI-assisted coding:</strong> Using tools like Cursor, GitHub
			Copilot, and similar assistants to streamline development workflows.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Content creation:</strong> Exploring the balance between AI-generated
			content and human creativity and editorial judgment.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Workflow optimization:</strong> Finding ways to automate the
			mundane and focus human energy on higher-value creative and strategic
			thinking.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Accessibility:</strong> Making advanced AI tools approachable
			for non-technical users and small teams.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Connect With Me</h2>

	<p>
		Domdhi is as much about community as it is about content. I'm always
		interested in hearing about your experiences with AI tools, answering
		questions, or exploring potential collaborations.
