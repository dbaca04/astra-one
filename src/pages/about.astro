	<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-theme-text mb-4">Hello, I'm Domdhi</h2>

	<p class="text-lg text-theme-text mb-6 leading-relaxed">
		I created Domdhi as a personal space to document my journey exploring
		the rapidly evolving world of AI tools and technologies. With a
		background in software development and a passion for creative
		problem-solving, I've been fascinated by how AI is transforming both
		technical and creative workflows.
	</p>

	<p class="text-lg text-theme-text mb-8 leading-relaxed">
		This site serves as both a journal of my experiences and a resource hub
		for others interested in incorporating AI into their work and creative
		processes.

		The Domdhi Mission
	</h2>

	<p class="text-lg text-theme-text mb-8 leading-relaxed">
		My goal with Domdhi is to bridge the gap between AI's technical
		capabilities and practical, everyday applications. I believe that AI
		tools should be accessible to everyone, not just technical specialists,
		and I'm committed to sharing what I learn in a way that's approachable
		and actionable.

		My interest in AI began with simple productivity tools but quickly
		expanded as I witnessed the rapid development of models like GPT and
		Stable Diffusion. What started as curiosity has evolved into an ongoing
		exploration of how these technologies can enhance both my professional
		work and creative hobbies.
